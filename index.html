        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>People with amnesia often struggle to recognize 
            familiar faces, which can lead to difficulties 
            in identifying friends, family, or regular visitors
             at their home. This inability can severely disrupt 
             their social interactions and compromise their safety.  
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>By integrating facial recognition technology into a 
            doorbell system, our solution aims to help individuals 
            with amnesia easily identify visitors, enhancing their 
            independence, security, and confidence in managing daily
             social interactions at their doorstep.</p>
